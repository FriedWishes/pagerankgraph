PageRankGraph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project visualizes the calculations behind a site's search engine
ranking, by drawing a weighted network graph of the inbound links. The
source data is derived from page-scraping Blekko's detailed SEO page for
the domain and the top 25 inbound link providers. The rendering is done
using the Canvas HTML5 extension, together with a lightweight force-
directed graph JQuery plugin I created.
